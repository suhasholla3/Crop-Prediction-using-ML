Predicting crop with help of machine learning through python user interface
India being an agricultural country, its economy predominantly depends on agriculture yield
growth and allied agro industry products. In India, agriculture is largely influenced by
rainwater which is highly unpredictable. Agriculture growth also depends on diverse soil
parameters, namely Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Crop rotation, Soil moisture, Surface
temperature and also on weather aspects which include temperature, rainfall, etc. India now
is rapidly progressing towards technical development. Thus, technology will prove to be
beneficial to agriculture which will increase crop productivity resulting in better yields to the
farmer. The proposed project provides a solution for Smart Agriculture by monitoring the
agricultural field, which can assist the farmers in increasing productivity to a great extent.
Weather forecast data obtained from IMD (Indian Metrological Department) such as
temperature and rainfall and soil parameters repository gives insight into which crops are
suitable to be cultivated in a particular area. This work presents a system to predict the most
profitable crop in the current weather and soil conditions.
